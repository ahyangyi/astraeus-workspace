ASTREAUS PACKAGE BUILDER
========================

This is a Bazel Workspace that builds some open-source libraries and applications without using their own build systems.
This is largely experimental for fun, but it might have potential real usages as it provides a uniform interface to building things.
For example, a compiler developer might find testing his new compiler plugin on all the open source projects in this repository valuable.
